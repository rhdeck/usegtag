# usegtag
Connect your react app to Google Analytics with a simple hook 

## Strong Recommendation
Add `@types/gtag.js` as a dependency to a project that implements `useGtag`. This will give you much better type completion
```bash
npm i @types/gtag.js --development --save
```
or
```bash
yarn add -D @types/gtag.js
```
